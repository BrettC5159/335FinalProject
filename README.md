## Note to graders

To use the project, you must log in with the burner Spotify account we created.
This is because when an app is in development, Spotify only lets it have 25 accounts connected, and
all the accounts must be manually added. We wanted you guys to be able to add your own music, but
getting permission/review from Spotify to fully release the app wasn't possible for this project.
We played some music on the burner account we made, so it can contribute meaningful data 
(Brett and I also put our Spotify data in). If you are interested in adding your own music, contact us
and we can get that set up for you.

## Description

Our project creates a playlist of the top 50 songs at UMD.
To do this, we use the Spotify Web API to get each user's top songs.
The songs are stored in a MongoDB database, and we use these to find the top 50 songs.
We create a Spotify playlist (using the API) with all of the songs.
